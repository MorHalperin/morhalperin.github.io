             Mor is painter, crafter and dweller. Through the years Mor had learned several crafts and studies like Classic Animation, Illustration,
                Traditional Goldsmithing and casting.<br><br> The path is at times unclear, with lots of experimentation of different mediums over the years, including jewelry making, lost-wax casting, oil painting, digital art and design, 
                making game jams and learning how to code and creat art for games.<br><br>

                Three years ago, moving to Finland had a great impact on her artistic direction and she was inspired to pursue both practices, the traditional art making, next to the digital one.
                With her current B/A Psychology studies, she plans to make use of art and expression, to impower and connect, just what Art Theraphy has done for her.<br><br>

                She had exhibited her paintings in galleries in Helsinki, with her first Solo Exhibition at Cerma coming next year in August, 2024.<br><br>

                As a painter her artistic path is that of channeling comfort, faith, passion, freedom, curiosity, and playfulness.
                Mor's influences range from wild animals and expressive naturalistic themes to serene and naive scenes, depicting styles from rustic to whimsical.
